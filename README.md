# Traineeship-backup-from-drive-and-ftp
This is my code from practise. In this program you can do backup form ftp (from txt file with paths), from drive and from database (in future).
All files will zipping to one file .zip.

You must use Apache library:
commons-io-2.6.jar and
commons-net-3.3-ftp.jar
